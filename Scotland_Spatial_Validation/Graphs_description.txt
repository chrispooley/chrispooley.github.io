PAGE 1: "Parameter priors: The prior captures any knowledge regarding parameter values before the data is considered. This table shows the priors places on each of the model parameters.  Click on the parameter names (in blue) to link to where they appear in the model."
Parameter_estimates.csv

PAGE 2: "Posterior parameter estimates: This table provides posterior estimates for each of the model parameters. The first column gives the parameter name followed by the posterior mean, 95% credible interval and standard deviation.  The effective samples size (ESS) provides an estimate of the number of independent posterior samples generated (exceeding 200 implies convergence) and the Gelman-Rubin statistic (GRS) measures how well independent runs map out the same posterior distribution (less than around 1.05 usually implies convergence). Note, ESS and GRS are not available for all inference methods. Finally a column shows the prior (as defined in the TOML file) for comparison.  Click on the parameter names (in blue) to link to where they appear in the model."

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file cases_area_cut.csv).  The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state.  Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from the observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior distribution."

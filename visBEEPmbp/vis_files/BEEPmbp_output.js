table IH.csv: This shows the temporal variation in the number of individual transitions per unit time moving from the I to the H compartment for S12000028.  The black line shows the raw data (from the input file IH.csv).  The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state.  Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from the observation model).

table CD.csv: This shows the temporal variation in the number of individual transitions per unit time moving from the C to the D compartment for S12000008.  The black line shows the raw data (from the input file CD.csv).  The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state.  Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from the observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior

table CD.csv: This shows the temporal variation in the number of individual transitions per unit time moving from the C to the D compartment for S12000026.  The black line shows the raw data (from the input file CD.csv).  The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state.  Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from the observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior

table CD.csv: This shows the temporal variation in the number of individual transitions per unit time moving from the C to the D compartment for S12000028.  The black line shows the raw data (from the input file CD.csv).  The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state.  Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from the observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior

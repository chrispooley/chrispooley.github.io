The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model). Large deviations between the two lines indicate that either the model is not able to properly account for the actual observed system dynamics, or that inference has not converged on the true posterior

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

The black line shows the raw data (from the input file Efrac.csv). The red line (with dashed 95% credible intervals) shows the posterior distribution for the inferred underlying system state. Under a suitable model, and with accurate inferece, it would be expected that the black and red curves exhibit the same temporal behaviour (barring variation coming from a weak observation model).

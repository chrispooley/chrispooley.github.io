The ME is a measure for comparing how well the data agrees with the model. When performing model comparison care must be taken to ensure it is done so at a consistent value of error function cut-off.  The ratio in ME gives the Bayes factors between models. A Bayes factor above 3.2 is considered substantial support for one model over another, and over 10 provides strong evidence.","tab":"Model Evidence","tab2":"","tab3":"","tab4":"","title":"Model evidence as a function of log(EF cut-off)","xaxis":"log(EF cut-off)","yaxis":"log(Model evidence)","min":1e+09,"max":1e+09,"source":"This uses columns 4 and 7 in *Diagnostics/Generation.csv*|","line":[{"name":"","xcol":[2.98121,2.82882,2.6252,2.37762,2.17268,1.98345,1.83048,1.6617,1.53044,1.38999,1.26536,1.1453,1.01659,0.862259,0.731184,0.602637,0.451598,0.344682,0.213681,0.112514,0.00815395,-0.0979904,-0.181541,-0.269665,-0.359053,-0.440046,-0.513587,-0.601651,-0.685321,-0.756445,-0.81582,-0.887395,-0.941916,-1.01071,-1.06856,-1.12043,-1.17259,-1.21545,-1.26215,-1.30279,-1.34117,-1.37621,-1.41602,-1.44757,-1.48207,-1.51382,-1.54029,-1.57305,-1.59953,-1.62612,-1.64947,-1.67318,-1.69869,-1.72193,-1.74286,-1.76877,-1.78884,-1.80997,-1.82966,-1.84768,-1.86523,-1.88066,-1.894,-1.90904,-1.9251,-1.93926,-1.9499,-1.96057,-1.97034,-1.98052,-1.99142,-2.00161,-2.0119,-2.02083,-2.02946,-2.03847,-2.04665,-2.05489,-2.0629,-2.06914,-2.07676,-2.08427,-2.09186,-2.09938,-2.10543,-2.11243,-2.11799,-2.12373,-2.12951,-2.13511,-2.13998,-2.14537,-2.14927,-2.15319,-2.15827,-2.16147,-2.1654,-2.1692,-2.17308,-2.1757],"ycol":[-0.693147,-1.38629,-2.09673,-2.80069,-3.49906,-4.23666,-4.94806,-5.69927,-6.3516,-6.94943,-7.60062,-8.20476,-8.8109,-9.54641,-10.2694,-10.928,-11.6562,-12.3195,-13.0479,-13.7185,-14.4267,-15.1928,-15.8231,-16.5187,-17.2681,-17.9978,-18.6407,-19.4218,-20.1765,-20.867,-21.5079,-22.2464,-22.9294,-23.6819,-24.3751,-25.0531,-25.7716,-26.4521,-27.2019,-27.9027,-28.6139,-29.3045,-30.0414,-30.6604,-31.3585,-31.98,-32.5663,-33.2641,-33.9079,-34.5589,-35.2237,-35.8721,-36.6069,-37.3101,-37.9982,-38.727,-39.3876,-40.0538,-40.7543,-41.4881,-42.1787,-42.8061,-43.4896,-44.1633,-44.8712,-45.6235,-46.2937,-46.9308,-47.5558,-48.18,-48.8521,-49.5146,-50.215,-50.8838,-51.5527,-52.2883,-52.9227,-53.6761,-54.4681,-55.0997,-55.8258,-56.4939,-57.2021,-57.9846,-58.6989,-59.405,-60.0556,-60.7789,-61.5133,-62.2116,-62.8997,-63.5878,-64.2227,-64.8871,-65.6454,-66.2166,-66.9484,-67.6341,-68.3652,-69.0088],"style":"BLACK_SOLID"}]}],"boundaries" : [[[]]]}';
